During my development endevours, there will be moments where I omit doing something in code that I should be doing.  I may do this because it is easier to do it a different way for now and implement the correct way once we get a decent app established.  Here lies some TODOs to get back to.


Data-Service

1. Implement backend code with firebase to handle monetary transactions.  As it stands now, the payment calculations and handling are handled on the client device's end, which makes it an easy target for scamming individuals.
2. Apply proper authentication rules to various parts of the database
3. Implement payment systems with google wallet and paypal



Profile Screen

1. Beautify the edit profile modal.  Currently, it creates a very ugly card that works, however doesn't create a pleasant user experience.


Beer Search

1. Include the featured item with the same animations as the rest.
